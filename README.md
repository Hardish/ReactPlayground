This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
## Welcome to the React Playground

REMEMBER TO NPM INSTALL FIRST TO MAKE SURE YOUR DEPENDENCIES ARE UP TO DATE.

In order to use the NPM command in your terminal, make sure to download Node first https://nodejs.org/en/download/

In this project, take the time to look through the React-Bootstrap library's Components tab. Implement the following components with State and Event Listeners in mind.  There are examples provided to help give you some ideas on how to structure your components. Have fun!

### Running Tests

```console
npm test 
```

This will run any tests in the __tests__ folder, as long as they end in test.js or .js. Place your test files here. 

Note: the tests run on Jest (not Mocha). 

Once you've run this command, you'll have to kill the process with ctrl + C. 

Otherwise, it will keep running and any changes you make a file will cause the tests to re-run.


### Running the App

To start, run 'npm start' in your preferred terminal.

Note: Any changes you make to the code while this action is running will cause the app to rebuild. This allows for modifying the code and being able to immediately see the changes in the browser. To kill this process, hit ctrl + C in the terminal.


### Assignments

#### Task 1

This takes place on a new repository that is not open to commits from the public. So you’ll have to fork it.

The “head” branch will be development. This means you always want to fetch changes from development before beginning work.

Once you’ve fetched and merged into your development branch, start a new branch that is appropriately named to describe what changes you’re making.


If you have an idea of something you’d like to implement on the website, create an issue on the repo describing what you’d like to do. For example, we could use a navigation menu. Anyone who considers themselves proficient in react, I encourage to suggest new features for the website in this manner.

The assignment for everyone is as follows:

Part 1 - Create React Component
We’re going to practice creating react components using the react-bootstrap library. The components you create will make use of “props” and “state”. 

Part 2 - Create a unit test for your component. Note, there is a test that runs that checks that everything in the App.js component can render. But we want to test the specifics of your component.

Part 3 - Place your component somewhere within the application. 

Part 4 - Make use of the InternInfoDisplay component to display information about yourself.

These should all be nested under a branch. You can name it *yourname*-react-task1.
